  <h1>This site, right here!</h1>
  <p>
    I made this website to keep my knowledge current.
    During my studies I learned <strong>AngularJS</strong> and shortly after
    <strong>Angular (2+)</strong> was released. So I was compelled to keep myself up-to-date
    and make this website to stay sharp.
